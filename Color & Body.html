    <p>Several years ago, the makers of M&Ms - an American candy that contains an assortment of different colored chocolate sweets -added a new color to its candy bag: Blue. Blue ? Why Blue? Although they reported that this was the result of a vote by M&M's fans it raises a few questions. It may very well be the last color left in the bag after the novelty wears off.</p>
