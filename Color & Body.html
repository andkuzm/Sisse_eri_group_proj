            <p>Several years ago, the makers of M&Ms - an American candy that contains an assortment of different colored chocolate sweets - added a new color to its candy bag: Blue. Blue? Why Blue? Although they reported that this was the result of a vote by M&M's fans it raises a few questions. It may very well be the last color left in the bag after the novelty wears off.</p>

    <h3>Why is blue an unappetizing color?</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Blue food is a rare occurrence in nature. There are no leafy blue vegetables (blue lettuce?), no blue meats (blueburger, well-done please), and aside from blueberries and a few blue-purple potatoes from remote spots on the globe, blue just doesn't exist in any significant quantity as a natural food color.</p>
        <p>Consequently, we don't have an automatic appetite response to blue. Furthermore, our primal nature avoids food that are poisonous. A million years ago, when our earliest ancestors were foraging for food, blue, purple and black were "color warning signs" of potentially lethal food.</p>
