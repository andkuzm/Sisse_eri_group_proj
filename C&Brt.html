        <h3 id="ht">The Power of Images</h3>
        <div id="leftt">
            <p>
                A single image delivers a lot of information in a very short time because we perceive an image all at once.
                Whereas reading or hearing often takes significantly longer to process the same information. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A recent study found that images of brands trigger religious reactions.
                Dr. Gemma Calvert discovered that when people viewed images associated with the strong brands— the iPod, the Harley-Davidson, the Ferrari, and others— their
                brains registered the exact same patterns of activity as they did when they viewed the religious images.

            <h3>The Power of Shapes and Colors</h3>
            <p>Brands communicate meanings with the language of color and shape. As the overused cliché says, "A picture is worth a thousand words."</p>
            <p>
                There are natural — or universal — associations evoked by shapes and colors that are common to all of us: 
                For example, a horizontal line is stable and a diagonal line is dynamic. 
                Red is hot and full of fire, blue is cool and watery — or intangible like the sky.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h4>About Shapes</h4>
            <p>
                Colors and shapes work in harmony with each other to communicate. 
                Therefore, an understanding of shapes is essential to understanding the power of color in branding.
            </p>

                Even the most basic geometrical shapes can be soft or hard, stable or threatening. 
                The image below illustrates basic geometric shapes and contemporary symbols that evolved from basic shapes.

            <h3>The Power of Color</h3>
            <p>
                Our minds are programmed to respond to color. For example, we stop our cars for red lights and go on green.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider the effects of color in the image of contemporary symbols below.
