            <div id="leftt">
                <p>
                    A single image delivers a lot of information in a very short time because we perceive an image all at once.
                    Whereas reading or hearing often takes significantly longer to process the same information. 
                </p>

                    A recent study found that images of brands trigger religious reactions.
                    Dr. Gemma Calvert discovered that when people viewed images associated with the strong brands— the iPod, the Harley-Davidson, the Ferrari, and others— their
                    brains registered the exact same patterns of activity as they did when they viewed the religious images.

                <h3>The Power of Shapes and Colors</h3>
                <p>Brands communicate meanings with the language of color and shape. As the overused cliché says, "A picture is worth a thousand words."</p>
                <p>
                    There are natural — or universal — associations evoked by shapes and colors that are common to all of us: 
                    For example, a horizontal line is stable and a diagonal line is dynamic. 
                    Red is hot and full of fire, blue is cool and watery — or intangible like the sky.

                <h4>About Shapes</h4>
                <p>
                    Colors and shapes work in harmony with each other to communicate. 
                    Therefore, an understanding of shapes is essential to understanding the power of color in branding.

                    Even the most basic geometrical shapes can be soft or hard, stable or threatening. 
                    The image below illustrates basic geometric shapes and contemporary symbols that evolved from basic shapes.

                <h3>The Power of Color</h3>
                <p>
                    Our minds are programmed to respond to color. For example, we stop our cars for red lights and go on green.
                </p>

                    Consider the effects of color in the image of contemporary symbols below.
