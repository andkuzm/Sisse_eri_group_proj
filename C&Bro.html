        <h3>Color Design and Psychology for Branding</h3>
        <p>
            Brands and color are inextricably linked because color offers an instantaneous method for conveying meaning and message without words.
            Branding is a word commonly referred to by advertisers and marketing people, but what does it actually mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            Marketing experts define "brand" as the "name, term, sign, symbol or design, or a combination of them intended to identify a company's products or services."
            In other words, a brand communicates the "idea" of company or product. This is what forms the connection with consumers.
        </p>

              <div class="text">The JAL (Japan AirLines) image has several components: The bird symbolizes flight and the color red communicates power. 
                Red also symbolizes good luck in Asia. The circle and the color red reference the flag of Japan. 
                Therefore, the brand image communicates powerful air transportation from a Japanese company — and good luck with the journey.</div>
