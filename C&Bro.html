        <h3>Color Design and Psychology for Branding</h3>
        <p>
            Brands and color are inextricably linked because color offers an instantaneous method for conveying meaning and message without words.
            Branding is a word commonly referred to by advertisers and marketing people, but what does it actually mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            Marketing experts define "brand" as the "name, term, sign, symbol or design, or a combination of them intended to identify a company's products or services."
            In other words, a brand communicates the "idea" of company or product. This is what forms the connection with consumers.
        </p>
        <h4>For example, in the illustration of the three brand images:</h4>
        <p>
            <div id="rightff">
                <img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HmFickfWrOnPNIayhuFn9F1MQLzLQG7l9aElCpqVxs0FBGqA5AlzKOiMgwdhoS7seQ" alt="JAL brand logo" width="150" height="150">
            </div>
            <div id="leftf">
                The JAL (Japan AirLines) image has several components: The bird symbolizes flight and the color red communicates power. 
                Red also symbolizes good luck in Asia. The circle and the color red reference the flag of Japan. 
                Therefore, the brand image communicates powerful air transportation from a Japanese company â€” and good luck with the journey.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div id="rightft">
                <img src="https://www.att.com/ecms/dam/att/consumer/global/logos/att_globe_500x500.jpg" alt="AT&T brand logo" width="150" height="150">
            </div>
            <div id="leftf">
                The AT&T image is an award-winning design. The globe symbolizes a world circled by electronic communications.
                More specifically, the symbol is made up of very carefully delineated 'highlight' and 'shadow' elements.
                As a result, the symbol may be reproduced to give the impression of a three-dimensional sphere that is lighted from a distance source.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div id="rightfh">
                <img src="https://aved.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UPS-LOGO.jpg" alt="UPS brand logo" width="150" height="150">
            </div>
            <div id="leftf">
                The UPS (United Parcel Service) image is an excellent example of how a single color communicates meaning.
                Brown symbolizes dependability and solidity.
                (It is not a snobby color; it is not high technology; brown is grounded in the earth.)
