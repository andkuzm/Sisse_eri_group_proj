            Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. 
            However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful: The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.
            Color theories create a logical structure for color. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, 
            we can organize them </p><p>by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.<br><br>
            
            On this website of ours we will introduce you to several parts of our lives, which are connected to color theory,
            more precisely, how are colors being connected to body, brands and color symbolism,
            and try to present information, necessary for their understanding.</p>
