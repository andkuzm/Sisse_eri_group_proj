        <h2>The Basics of Color Theory</h2>
        <p>
            Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. 
            However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.
            Color theories create a logical structure for color. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, 
            we can organize them by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.
