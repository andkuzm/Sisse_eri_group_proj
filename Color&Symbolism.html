            <p>Color conveys meanings in two primary ways - natural associations and psychological symbolism. Successful design requires an awareness of how and why colors communicate meaning. The source of these meanings can be quite conspicuous, such as those found in nature — red is the color of blazing fire and blood, blue the color of cooling waters and the sky. Other meanings may be more complex and not universal. As a starting point, the communicative properties of a color can be defined by two categories: natural associations and psychological (or cultural) associations.

            Does color really matter? Aside from the obvious fact that pills are more attractive to the eye, color has indeed benefited consumers as well as the pharmaceutical companies in several very functional ways.
            First of all, color helps the consumer distinguish the non-prescription or prescription medications from other tablets or capsules. This is especially relevant for the elderly who get confused when they take various medications, most of which are small white tablets. Researchers have also found that patients who took more drugs on a daily basis preferred bright pill colors. Consequently, color and color combinations are a powerful way to create emotional appeal and reduce medical errors.

            The symbolism and the history of green are great examples of how the messages and meanings of any color varies and evolves over time.
The Evolution of the Symbolism of Green in Western culture:

In Celtic myths the Green man was the God of fertility.

Later in the millennium, Early Christians banned green because it had been used in pagan ceremonies.

Nevertheless, as evidenced by Van Eyck's 15th Century wedding portrait, the color green was the best choice for the bride's gown because of its earliest symbolism.
