        <h3>Color Design and Psychology for Branding</h3>
        <p>
            Brands and color are inextricably linked because color offers an instantaneous method for conveying meaning and message without words.
            Branding is a word commonly referred to by advertisers and marketing people, but what does it actually mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            Marketing experts define "brand" as the "name, term, sign, symbol or design, or a combination of them intended to identify a company's products or services."
            In other words, a brand communicates the "idea" of company or product. This is what forms the connection with consumers.
        </p>
        <h4>For example, in the illustration of the three brand images:</h4>
        <p>
            <div id="rightf">
                <img src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HmFickfWrOnPNIayhuFn9F1MQLzLQG7l9aElCpqVxs0FBGqA5AlzKOiMgwdhoS7seQ" alt="JAL brand logo" width="100" height="100">
            </div>
            <div if="leftf">
                The JAL (Japan AirLines) image has several components: The bird symbolizes flight and the color red communicates power. 
                Red also symbolizes good luck in Asia. The circle and the color red reference the flag of Japan. 
                Therefore, the brand image communicates powerful air transportation from a Japanese company — and good luck with the journey.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <div id="rightf" margin="10px">
                <img src="https://www.att.com/ecms/dam/att/consumer/global/logos/att_globe_500x500.jpg" alt="AT&T brand logo" width="100" height="100">
            </div>
            <div if="leftf">
                The AT&T image is an award-winning design. The globe symbolizes a world circled by electronic communications.
                More specifically, the symbol is made up of very carefully delineated 'highlight' and 'shadow' elements.
                As a result, the symbol may be reproduced to give the impression of a three-dimensional sphere that is lighted from a distance source.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div id="rightf">
                <img src="https://aved.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/UPS-LOGO.jpg" alt="UPS brand logo" width="100" height="100">
            </div>
            <div if="leftf">
                The UPS (United Parcel Service) image is an excellent example of how a single color communicates meaning.
                Brown symbolizes dependability and solidity.
                (It is not a snobby color; it is not high technology; brown is grounded in the earth.)
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>The Power of Images</h3>
        <p>
            A single image delivers a lot of information in a very short time because we perceive an image all at once.
            Whereas reading or hearing often takes significantly longer to process the same information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A recent study found that images of brands trigger religious reactions.
            Dr. Gemma Calvert discovered that when people viewed images associated with the strong brands— the iPod, the Harley-Davidson, the Ferrari, and others— their
            brains registered the exact same patterns of activity as they did when they viewed the religious images.
        </p>
        <h3>The Power of Shapes and Colors</h3>
        <p>Brands communicate meanings with the language of color and shape. As the overused cliché says, "A picture is worth a thousand words."</p>
        <p>
            There are natural — or universal — associations evoked by shapes and colors that are common to all of us: 
            For example, a horizontal line is stable and a diagonal line is dynamic. 
            Red is hot and full of fire, blue is cool and watery — or intangible like the sky.
        </p>
        <h4>About Shapes</h4>
        <p>
            Colors and shapes work in harmony with each other to communicate. 
            Therefore, an understanding of shapes is essential to understanding the power of color in branding.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even the most basic geometrical shapes can be soft or hard, stable or threatening. 
            The image below illustrates basic geometric shapes and contemporary symbols that evolved from basic shapes.

        <h3>The Power of Color</h3>
        <p>
            Our minds are programmed to respond to color. For example, we stop our cars for red lights and go on green.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the effects of color in the image of contemporary symbols below.

        <h3>The Power of Color for Brands</h3>
        <p>
            Brands and color are inextricably linked because color offers an instantaneous method for conveying meaning and message without words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Color is the visual component people remember most about a brand followed closely by shapes/symbols then numbers and finally words. 
            For example, the real McDonald's is easy to detect in the image below.
